# Heart-Diseases-Prediction
👉 "A Streamlit app that uses a trained Logistic Regression model to predict the likelihood of heart disease from patient information (age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.)."
🩺 Heart Disease Prediction App

This project is a machine learning application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient medical data. The app is built with Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit, making it interactive and easy to use.

🚀 Features

Predicts risk of heart disease using clinical parameters

Input fields include:

Age

Resting Blood Pressure

Cholesterol

Fasting Blood Sugar

Maximum Heart Rate

Oldpeak (ST depression)

Chest Pain Type

Resting ECG results

Exercise-induced angina

ST slope

Gender

Uses a trained Logistic Regression model

Simple web app interface with Streamlit

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python

scikit-learn (machine learning)

pandas & numpy (data processing)

Streamlit (app deployment)

📊 Model Training

Dataset: Heart Disease dataset (Kaggle / UCI)

Preprocessing: One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables

Train-Test Split: 80/20

Classifier: Logistic Regression

🌐 Deployment

The app can be deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud.
